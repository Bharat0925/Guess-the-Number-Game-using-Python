# Guess-the-Number-Game-using-Python
The "Guess the Number" game, also known as the "Number Guessing Game," is a simple and popular game where a player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a certain range. The game typically follows these basic rules:

1. The computer or game system selects a random number within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100).

2. The player is given an initial clue about the range of the number (e.g., "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100").

3. The player then makes a guess by choosing a number within the specified range.

4. The computer or game system provides feedback on the guess. It typically tells the player if the guess is "too high" or "too low."

5. The player continues to make guesses, refining their guess based on the feedback, until they guess the correct number.

6. The game keeps track of the number of attempts the player makes to guess the correct number.

7. The player wins when they guess the correct number, and the game provides a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to win.

The "Guess the Number" game is often used as a fun and educational exercise for programming beginners to practice coding in various programming languages, including Python. It helps teach concepts like random number generation, user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and more.

The simplicity and universal appeal of this game make it a popular choice for introducing programming concepts to beginners and for creating interactive, text-based games in various programming languages.
